- [problem] The research-assistant agent usually tries to fetch data with WebFetch and get's 404 errors.
  - It happens most of the times when searching code in github, maybe gh-cli is not able to fetch the data.
  * Maybe we should define some other tools for it to use?
- [deps] adds surf installation to the agent

- [problem] Sometimes I need to fetch data from Figma like images or text from the threads, search on those threads, or text from the design
  - I need a cli tool to fetch data from figma
- [problem] Janitor editing files, it may lack context and should not do it!
  - Maybe it must commit with # TODO: review comments -- Janitor
  - Then create a commit like [reviewed] or [TODO: review comments]
  - The implementator should review the comments and fix the code and amend changing the commit message to [addressed]
