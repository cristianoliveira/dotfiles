- [problem] The research-assistant agent usually tries to fetch data with WebFetch and get's 404 errors.
  - It happens most of the times when searching code in github, maybe gh-cli is not able to fetch the data.
  * Maybe we should define some other tools for it to use?
- [deps] adds surf installation to the agent
